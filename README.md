# frontend-portfolio

## Description

The challenge this week, was to create a portfolio website from scratch using our newly aquired skills - flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

This should culminate in a resonsive website that we can use to show off our frontend work as the programme progresses.

This was the acceptance criteria:

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager‚Äôs needs:

- When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
- When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

Here is a link to the deployed website: (https://redpez.github.io/frontend-portfolio)
